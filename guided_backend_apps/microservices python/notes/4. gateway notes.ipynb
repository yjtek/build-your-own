    "    - Asynchronous/Synchronous Interservice Communication\n",
    "        - Synchronous communication:\n",
    "            - This just means that the client sending the request will wait for the response from the server, and does not do anything else in the meantime\n",
    "            - So the client is \"blocked\" until it gets a response, hence the term \"blocking request\"\n",
    "                - For example, API gateway and auth service is synchronous, because nothing happens until you receive a response, or an error from the auth service\n",
    "                - This means that the services are tightly coupled\n",
    "        - Asynchronous communication:\n",
    "            - Client does not need to await response of downstream service. \"Fire and forget\"\n",
    "            - This is achieved by using a queue. The API gateway posts the request to the queue, and continues processing client requests. The queue is responsible for making sure that the request gets sent to the converter\n",
    "            - If it were synchronous instead, someone converting a big file will block the service for everyone else until the conversion is completed\n",
    "            - So with the queue, the API gateway and the converter service becomes loosely coupled\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Strong vs Eventual Consistency\n",
    "        - Imagine we send a synchronous request for conversion. Once the user gets notified that the conversion is done, he is guaranteed to download the latest version of the conversion. Hence, the file transfer is strongly consistent\n",
    "        - Eventual consistency is, for example, if you do an asynchronous request. And you try to download the mp3 from mongoDB immediately. Though the ID exists, it is null, because conversion is not completed yet. It will eventually be completed, however, user has to contend with a period when the ID exists but the conversion does not"

    "        - So the service groups all of our gateway pods together, by using a **selector**. In our case, we use a label selector (i.e. `selector: matchLabels: app: gateway`) to determine which pods are part of its group\n",
    "        - So once we define a service, we can literally forget about individual pods. Everything is abstracted away from us. You just manage the service\n",
